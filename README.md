# My VIM setup

This is my incredibly cobbled together VIM setup. I'm still learning VIM and it's ecosystem but I'm impressed so far. I'm mostly using this on my mobile phone.

Currently depends on the device being rooted, I'm using LineageOS 15 at the moment.

## TODO:

* Install ocaml/opam on Termux and
  * Try to compile Flow to run on Android as currently it's "unsupported" even though ALE can run it...
* ~Try to get better split control.~
* Make setup responsive to device
* Get better/faster autocomplete for JS files.
  * Tried disabling `omni` for JS files but no benefit.
* Snippets
* Get `anyfed` working
  * Try to install docker
  * If that works, try to expose a port on `anyfed`
  * install docker client on Termux and map to `anyfed`
  * profit.
* Other stuff...

# My VIM setup

This is my incredibly cobbled together VIM setup. I'm still learning VIM and it's ecosystem but I'm impressed so far. I'm mostly using this on my mobile phone. This is targetted at making writing JS super fun.

Clone this repos

`make` should run all the tasks to setup both your laptop and your phone depending on where you run it.

## TODO:

* ~Try to get better split control.~
  * ~Stop NERDTree being open in 2 buffers when opening.~ Learn how to use VIM properly Dave.
  * ~Stop NERDTree opening file in a new split next to the other NERDTree buffer~ `nvim .` causes it to open NERDTree in the second buffer.
* Make setup responsive to device
  * Autohide NERDtree on mobile portrait mode on phone
  * Autoshow (if not manually closed) NERDTree in landscape/DEX mode.
* Better pointer support
* Get better/faster autocomplete for JS files.
  * Tried disabling `omni` for JS files but no benefit.
* Snippets
* Containers
  * Get `docker` installed or some way to proot environments safely on android.
  * Manage them safely.
* ~Ctags~
  * Stole from https://medium.com/adorableio/modern-javascript-ctags-configuration-199884dbcc1
* Workspace/session saving.
* Other stuff...

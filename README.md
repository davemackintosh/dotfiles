# My VIM setup

This is my incredibly cobbled together VIM setup. I'm still learning VIM and it's ecosystem but I'm impressed so far. I'm mostly using this on my One Plus 3

## TODO:

* Install ocaml/opam on Termux and
* Try to compile Flow to run on Android as currently it's unsupported
* ~Try to get better split control.~
* Get better/faster autocomplete for JS files.
  * Tried disabling `omni` for JS files but no benefit.
* Get `anyfed` working
  * Try to install docker
  * If that works, try to expose a port on `anyfed`
  * install docker client on Termux and map to `anyfed`
  * profit.
* Other stuff...
